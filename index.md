## #sustainabletransport
_A FAIR Cross-Platform Social Media Analysis Approach to Sociotechnical Sustainable Transport Research_



### Abstract:

The paper reports findings from a FAIR principles-based research project dedicated to investigating 
how cross-field research between the DH and Sociotechnical Sustainable Transport Research could help 
to enhance the holistic understanding of sociotechnical low-carbon transport transitions. 
Using the hashtag search queries #sustainabletransport and #sustainablemobility, 33,121 Tweets (2013-2021) 
and 8,089 Instagram images including captions (2017/2018-2021) were mined using Python scripts. 
Quantitative text and sentiment analyses were applied to the Tweets and image captions. 
Additionally, an automated image analysis using the Instagram dataset was conducted. 
Synthesized results formed the base for the cross-platform analysis comprising: 1) hot topics, 
2) mentioned users, 3) sentiment, 4) co-hashtags. Data were visualized via Tableau, Excel, RAWGraphs, and Bubbl.us. 
Whereas electromobility, one of Holden et al.’s Grand Narratives for sustainable mobility, has been 
significantly present in the digital discourse on both platforms (especially Instagram), #sustainabletransport 
has been closely associated with active transport, especially bicycling, and #sustainablemobility with 
the electromobility theme. The study has demonstrated the investigative potentials of cross-field 
cross-platform social media analysis studies and ultimately DH to enhance the understanding of 
sociotechnical low-carbon transport transitions. Drawing on core results, the paper also suggests 
an adapted version of the Geelsean Multi-Level Perspective.  

# Research Question: 
## How can the Digital Humanities help to enhance the understanding of sociotechnical low-carbon transport transitions?
### Sub-Questions:
**1	What are key themes in the social media discourse about #sustainablemobility and #sustainabletransport on Twitter and Instagram?**

_1.1.  How does the discourse on Twitter and Instagram differ?_

_1.2.  What are the potential reasons for these differences?_

_1.3.  What are suitable ways to comprehensively visualize the commonalities and differences?_

_1.4.  How can this knowledge be implemented into sociotechnical sustainable transport research?_


**2.	How can social media analysis help to further the understanding of sociotechnical phenomena and processes in low-carbon transport transitions?**

_2.1. What are the potentials and limitations of quantitative social media text mining in the context of sociotechnical sustainable transport research?_

_2.2. What are the potentials and limitations of social media sentiment analysis in the context of sociotechnical sustainable transport research?_

_2.3. In what ways can hashtag-based multi/cross-social media platform analysis using Twitter and Instagram help to obtain a more holistic picture of social media discourse on sustainable transport?_

**3.	How can the Digital Humanities help to make sociotechnical sustainable transport research more collaborative and sustainable per se?**

_3.1. How would sociotechnical sustainable transport research benefit from FAIR data sharing?_

_3.2. What are ways to foster sustainable and FAIR data sharing practices in digital sociotechnical sustainable transport research?_
